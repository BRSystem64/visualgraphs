 Visual Graphs allows that you build graphs. Graphs is a object of graph theory study, which are mathematical structures used to model relations between objects.

> You can read more about Graphs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).
 
 
 ## How to use?
### **1. Creating a Node**
  You just have an input on page, where you can type a name to your new node, you can press start(on your keyboard) or the button add to create a new node. The node is generated on the workspace.
 
### **2. Free Mode**
  You can move nodes on workspace. on your sidebar you have the option Free Mode, click there and after press left button on the node that you want to move.

### **3. Making Connections**
 The Graphs can have many connections, some connections are unidirectional or bidirectional, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Select the type of connection that you want, and select your first node. After selected your first node, you can see the name on the top of workspace, as **cache node: Node 1**. Then select your second node and *voil√†*, you connected two nodes.

### **4. Cost**
The nodes connections have costs, for default the cost are 0 and you can\'t see the value. But if you want see the value of costs, you can active the **show cost** on the sidebar. You can choice ths costs of connection, select the first node and the second node, a dialog will ask for you the value of new cost. (Only numbers)
